# Learning Python

## Who Is This Book For?
        
- The goal of these chapters is to bring you up to speed with python as quickly as possible so you can build programs that works while developing foundation in programming that will serve you for the rest of your life. 
- Learning Python is written for people of any age who have never programmed in Python before or have never programmed at all.
                
## What Can You Expect to Learn?

- The purpose of these chapters is to make you a good programmer in general and a good Python programmer in particular.
- You’ll learn efficiently and adopt good habits as I provide you with a solid foundation in general programming concepts.
- After working your way through these chapters, you should be ready to move on to more advanced Python techniques, and your next programming language will be even easier to grasp.
        
## Why Python?

- Every year I consider whether to continue using Python or whether to move on to a different language—perhaps one that’s newer to the programming world. But I continue to focus on Python for many reasons.
- Python is an incredibly efficient language. your programs will do more in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also help you write “clean” code.
- Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug, and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.
